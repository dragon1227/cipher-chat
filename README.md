# CipherChat

An end-to-end ecrypted instant messaging application built on MERN Stack.

## Setup

Instructions on how to start the project on your local machine...

### Requirements

1. Node.js
2. Mongodb

### Installation of Dependencies

1. Run `npm i` on the root directory.
2. Just in case it asks you, run `npm audit fix --force`.
3. Do step 1 and 2 now on the client directory.

### Confirguration

- Look at the /config director for the server configuration such as the mongodb uri.

### Running the app

A. Development

- Run `npm start` both on the client directory and the root directory.

B. Production

- Run `npm run build-start` on the root directory, this will create a build of the client
  and run the backend server in production mode serving the static files directly.

## Implementation Details:

1. Security
   #### Hashing
   - (Previously SHA256) **PBKDF2** (SHA512 digest, 64 length) for hashing the auth of each user account,  
     incorporated with a salt unique for each user. PBKDF2 25,000 rounds on client, sent to  
     server then another 50,000 rounds of PBKDF2, saved as auth on the database and sent back  
     to the client for another 25,000 rounds of PBKDF2 forming the passphrase for encrypting  
     the private key of the user.
   #### Encryption
   - (Previously RSA) AES for encrypting the private key of the user stored on the database, passphrase  
     is created as explained above. Also used for encrypting chat messages, only private channels, explained  
     below.
   #### Key Exchange
   - (Previously RSA) ECDH for public key exchange for two participants obtaining the same one secret key  
     to be used as the passphrase for encrypting/decrypting chat messages on their private channels.
2. New Features
   - Online/Offline realtime status for each user using websockets
   - Improved User searching, and added Online Users tab
   - Sent/Seen Chat Message status on private channels (Not realtime)
   - Inbox!
   - Send Private Messages directly from Global by clicking the recepients's name.
   - Input cooldown to fight spam
   - Stricter Password Rules
3. Design/Layout
   - Redesigned Homepage/Login/Register Page
   - Redesigned Profile Layout
   - Redesigned NavBar Layout
   - Redesigned Footer
   - More Box Shadows
   - Styled Components from plain CSS styling

### OLD Implementation Process:

1. The User registers with two input fields:
   - `username` (unique for all users)
   - `password`
2. SHA256 Hash function comes into play with this two fields, creating these datas:
   - `auth = SHA256(username + password);`
     - This gets saved onto the database, and will be used to authenticate user  
       without storing the password.
   - `passphrase = SHA256(auth + password);`
     - This is stored locally only. This serves as the passphrase seed for generating  
       the user's private key and public key.
   - `privateKey = generateRSAKey(passphrase, 1024);`
     - Creates a 1024 bit RSA private key, used to generate public key, this is not  
       sent to the server.
   - `publicKey = publicKeyString(privateKey);`
     - Derives a public key from the private key, this is sent onto the server and saved  
       for everyone to see and able to send messages privately.
3. The User Logins with `username` and `password`
   - `auth = SHA256(username + password)` for authentication
     - if success, jwt token will be saved locally and the `passphrase` for generating  
       the keys.
4. Global Channel **(Not Encrypted)**
   - Clients sends `msgObj` containing `senderName`, `message`, and `timestamp` on plain text  
     and `"global"` as the msgObj's `channel`
   - Client fetches all msgObj with `channel === "global` as filter, and displaying them in  
     asc order based on their timestamp. \* Styling: If `senderName === username`, chatbubble will be displayed on the left side  
      and be labeled sent by `You`.
5. Private Channels **(Encrypted e2e)**
   - The User chooses someone to chat on a private channel
     - `userPublicKey` and `otherUserPublicKey` hashed with md5 will be their converstation's  
       private `channelId`.
       - `channelId = "0eRdpe5e7718b338fy12g130f6cb3f24"`
   - When The User sends a message, it creates 2 encrypted copies before it's sent to server.
     1. msgObj is encrypted with the `userPublicKey`. `name`, `message`, and `timestamp` fields are all encrypted.  
        Adds a `pbkHash` field which is a `SHA256` hash of the public key used to encrypt the msgObj.
        \_ `pbkHash = 5ccd628243718daagr5a2a10444c2a30b5f51016dd12382f8af6f2dffa721`
        - The User will be the only one who can decrypt and read this message.
     2. msgObj is encrypted with The `otherUserPublicKey`. Same fields encrypted, same field added.
        - otherUser will be the only one who can decrypt and read this message.
     - Two encrypted copies: One encrypted with the **sender's public key** and one with the **recipient's public key**
   - Client fetches all msgObj with `channel === "0eRdpe5e7718b338fy12g130f6cb3f24"` and `pbkHash === 5ccd628243718daagr5a2a10444c2a30b5f51016dd12382f8af6f2dffa721` as filter, and displaying them in asc  
     order based on their timestamp. \* This will only fetch msgObjects encrypted using the `userPublicKey` which can then be decrypted  
      using `userPrivateKey`

### Simple Explanation

Alice and Bob exchanges public keys with each other, when Alice sends a message to Bob she encrypts it with Bob's  
Public Key and another copy with her publicKey. Bob does the same when he sends his messages. Alice then fetches  
all messages on their channel that was encrypted using her public key and decrypts the conversation with her private  
key then displayed on the client.
